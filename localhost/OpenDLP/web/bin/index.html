<normal>OpenDLP is a free and open source, agent-based, centrally-managed, massively distributable data loss prevention tool released under the GPL. OpenDLP can identify sensitive data at rest on thousands of systems simultaneously. OpenDLP has two components:<br><br>
<u>Web Application</u><br>
<li>Automatically deploy and start agents over SMB</li>
<li>When done, automatically stop, uninstall, and delete agents over SMB</li>
<li>Pause, resume, and forcefully uninstall agents in an entire scan or on individual systems</li>
<li>Concurrently and securely receive results from hundreds or thousands of deployed agents</li>
<li>Create Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCREs) for finding sensitive data at rest</li>
<li>Create reusable profiles for scans that include whitelisting or blacklisting directories and file extensions</li>
<li>Review findings and identify false positives</li>
<li>Export results as XML</li>
<li>Manage Windows and UNIX agentless OS scans, Windows Metasploit agent scans, Windows agentless share scans, and database scans</li>
<br>
<u>Windows Agent</u><br>
<li>Runs on Windows 2000 and later systems</li>
<li>Written in C with no .NET Framework requirements</li>
<li>Runs as a Windows Service at low priority so users do not see or feel it</li>
<li>Resumes automatically upon system reboot with no user interaction</li>
<li>Securely transmit results to web application at user-defined intervals</li>
<li>Uses PCREs to identify sensitive data inside files</li>
<li>Performs additional checks on potential credit card numbers to reduce false positives</li>
<br>
<u>Metasploit Agent</u><br>
Everything the Windows Agent scan does, plus:<br>
<li>Completely integreated with Metasploit through Messagepack RPC</li>
<li>Retrieves list of exploited machines from Metasploit and displays in OpenDLP GUI</li>
<li>Deploys OpenDLP directly from Metasploit to exploied machines of your choosing</li>
<li>Domain credentials not required, if you can "get system" on the target from a metasploit ponsole, you can deploy OpenDLP</li>
<br>
<u>Agentless Database Scans</u><br>
Starting with OpenDLP 0.3, you can now perform agentless data discovery against the following databases:
<li>Microsoft SQL server databases: Supports authenticating to databases either with SQL server credentials (the "sa" account, for example) or with Windows OS (domain) credentials.</li>
<li>MySQL</li>
<br>
<u>Agentless OS and Share Scans</u><br>
Starting with OpenDLP 0.4, you can now perform agentless data discovery against the following systems:
<li>Microsoft Windows operating systems over SMB</li>
<li>UNIX operating systems over SSH</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows network shares over SMB</li>
<br>
<u>To Get Started</u><br>
Assuming the README has been followed and OpenDLP is properly installed on the web server, you can:
<li><a href="regex-delete.html">Review existing PCREs</a> and <a href="regex.html">add your own</a></li>
<li><a href="profiles.html">Create a profile</a> with PCREs, appropriate authentication credentials, and other policy settings</li>
<li><a href="startscan.html">Start a scan</a> by providing a list of Windows systems</li>
<li><a href="viewresults.html">Review results</a> and mark false positives</li>
<li><a href="exportscan.html">Export the scan as XML</a> and use the data offline</li>
